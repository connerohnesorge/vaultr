# Rocks Instructions

Instructions for AI coding assistants using Rocks for spec-driven
development.

## TL;DR Quick Checklist

- Search existing work: Read `.rocks/changes/` and `.rocks/specs/`
  directories (use `rg` for full-text search)
- Decide scope: new capability vs modify existing capability
- Pick a unique `change-id`: kebab-case, verb-led (`add-`, `update-`,
  `remove-`, `refactor-`)
- Scaffold: `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `design.md` (only if needed), and delta
  specs per affected capability
- Write deltas: use `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED|RENAMED Requirements`; include
  at least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement
- Validate: `cnb rocks validate [change-id]` and fix issues
- Request approval: Do not start implementation until proposal is approved

## Two-Stage Workflow

### Stage 1: Creating Changes

Create proposal when you need to:

- Add features or functionality
- Make breaking changes (API, schema)
- Change architecture or patterns
- Optimize performance (changes behavior)
- Update security patterns

Loose matching guidance:

- Contains one of: `proposal`, `change`, `spec`
- With one of: `create`, `plan`, `make`, `start`, `help`

Skip proposal for:

- Bug fixes (restore intended behavior)
- Typos, formatting, comments
- Dependency updates (non-breaking)
- Configuration changes
- Tests for existing behavior

Workflow:

1. Review `.rocks/project.md` and read `.rocks/specs/` and
   `.rocks/changes/` directories to understand current context.
2. Choose a unique verb-led `change-id` and scaffold `proposal.md`,
   `tasks.md`, optional `design.md`, and spec deltas under
   `.rocks/changes/<id>/`.
3. Draft spec deltas using `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED Requirements` with at
   least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement.
4. Run `cnb rocks validate <id>` and resolve any issues before sharing the
   proposal.

### Stage 2: Implementing Changes

Track these steps as TODOs and complete them one by one.

1. Read proposal.md - Understand what's being built
2. Read design.md (if exists) - Review technical decisions
3. Read tasks.md - Get implementation checklist
4. Implement tasks sequentially - Complete in order
5. Confirm completion - Ensure every item in `tasks.md` is finished before
   updating statuses
6. Update checklist - After all work is done, set every task to `- [x]` so the
   list reflects reality
7. Approval gate - Do not start implementation until the proposal is reviewed
   and approved

## Before Any Task

Context Checklist:

- [ ] Read relevant specs in `specs/[capability]/spec.md`
- [ ] Check pending changes in `changes/` for conflicts
- [ ] Read `.rocks/project.md` for conventions
- [ ] Read `.rocks/changes/` directory to see active changes
- [ ] Read `.rocks/specs/` directory to see existing capabilities

Before Creating Specs:

- Always check if capability already exists
- Prefer modifying existing specs over creating duplicates
- Read `.rocks/specs/<capability>/spec.md` directly to review current state
- If request is ambiguous, ask 1-2 clarifying questions before scaffolding

### Search Guidance

- Enumerate specs: Read `.rocks/specs/` directory (or
  `cnb rocks spec list --long` for formatted output)
- Enumerate changes: Read `.rocks/changes/` directory (or `cnb rocks list` for
  formatted output)
- Read details directly:
  - Spec: Read `.rocks/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
  - Change: Read `.rocks/changes/<change-id>/proposal.md`
- Full-text search (use ripgrep):
  `rg -n "Requirement:|Scenario:" .rocks/specs`

## Quick Start

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Essential commands
cnb rocks list                  # List active changes
cnb rocks list --specs          # List specifications
cnb rocks validate [item]       # Validate changes or specs

# Project management
cnb rocks init [path]           # Initialize or update instruction files

# Interactive mode
cnb rocks validate              # Bulk validation mode

# Debugging
cnb rocks validate [change]
```

Reading Specs and Changes (for AI agents):

- Specs: Read `.rocks/specs/<capability>/spec.md` directly
- Changes: Read `.rocks/changes/<change-id>/proposal.md` directly
- Tasks: Read `.rocks/changes/<change-id>/tasks.md` directly

### Command Flags

- `--json` - Machine-readable output
- `--type change|spec` - Disambiguate items
- `--no-interactive` - Disable prompts

## Directory Structure

```text
.rocks/
├── project.md              # Project conventions
├── specs/                  # Current truth - what IS built
│   └── [capability]/       # Single focused capability

│   └── archive/            # Completed changes
```

## Architectural Decisions (ADRs)

Rocks has no separate `decisions/` directory. ADRs live inside the
relevant capability's `design.md` under a `## ADRs` section. The format
is intentionally close to a classic ADR but scoped to one capability.

```markdown
## ADRs

### ADR-0001: Short title

Context, decision, and consequences in 1-3 short paragraphs. Optional
**Considered alternatives** subsection when the rejected options are
worth remembering.

### ADR-0002: Another decision
...
```

Rules:

- Sequential numbering within one `design.md`. Scan the file for the
  highest existing `ADR-NNNN` and increment by one. Numbers do not need
  to be globally unique across capabilities.
- Header format: `### ADR-NNNN: Title` (4-digit zero-padded number,
  single space after colon). `cnb rocks validate` emits warnings on
  malformed headers, duplicate numbers, and numbering gaps within a
  single `design.md`.
- Don't write an ADR for an easy-to-reverse decision. Only record
  choices that are (a) hard to reverse, (b) surprising without context,
  and (c) the result of a real trade-off.

ADRs are hand-maintained: `cnb rocks validate` reports ADR issues as
advisory warnings only and never fails on them, and `cnb rocks archive`
merges `spec.md` Requirements only — it does not touch `design.md` or
promote its ADRs. So write capability-level ADRs directly into
`specs/<capability>/design.md`; a change's `design.md` ADRs stay with
the archived change under `changes/archive/` and are not promoted into
the capability's `design.md`.

Cross-cutting ADRs: pick the **primary** capability whose `design.md`
owns the ADR, and reference it from sibling capabilities by pointer
(`see <capability>/design.md ADR-NNNN`) rather than duplicating bodies.

## WHERE TO LOOK
| Task | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Create proposals | cnb rocks/changes/ | Scaffold with proposal.md, tasks.md, delta specs |
| Validate changes | cnb rocks validate | Enforce scenarios, formatting rules |
| Accept proposals | cnb rocks accept | Convert tasks.md → tasks.jsonc |
| Archive changes | cnb rocks archive | Merge deltas into specs/ |
| View status | cnb rocks view | Interactive dashboard |

## CONVENTIONS
- **Verb-led IDs**: Use `add-`, `update-`, `remove-`, `refactor-` prefixes
- **Delta operations**: Use `## ADDED`, `## MODIFIED`, `## REMOVED`, `## RENAMED Requirements`
- **Scenario format**: Use `#### Scenario:` (4 hashtags) with WHEN/THEN bullets
- **tasks.md + tasks.jsonc**: Both coexist, update status in .jsonc after accept

## UNIQUE PATTERNS
- **Spec-driven development**: All features tracked in specs/ before implementation
- **Three-stage workflow**: Propose → Validate (pre-implementation) → Archive (post-deployment)
- **Dual task files**: tasks.md (human-readable) + tasks.jsonc (machine-readable)

## ANTI-PATTERNS
- **NEVER implement without proposal**: Features need change in cnb rocks/changes/
- **DON'T skip validation**: Always run `cnb rocks validate` before `cnb rocks accept`
- **NO partial MODIFIED**: MODIFIED requirements must include complete content (header + all scenarios)
- **NO scenario-less requirements**: Every requirement must have at least one scenario


## Creating Change Proposals

### Decision Tree

```text
New request?
├─ Bug fix restoring spec behavior? → Fix directly
├─ Typo/format/comment? → Fix directly
├─ New feature/capability? → Create proposal
├─ Breaking change? → Create proposal
├─ Architecture change? → Create proposal
└─ Unclear? → Create proposal (safer)
```

### Proposal Structure

1. Create directory: `changes/[change-id]/` (kebab-case, verb-led, unique)

2. Write proposal.md:

```markdown
# Change: [Brief description of change]

## Why

[1-2 sentences on problem/opportunity]

## What Changes

- [Bullet list of changes]
- [Mark breaking changes with BREAKING]

## Impact

- Affected specs: [list capabilities]
- Affected code: [key files/systems]
```

1. Create spec deltas: `specs/[capability]/spec.md`

```markdown
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: New Feature

The system SHALL provide...

#### Scenario: Success case

- WHEN user performs action
- THEN expected result

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Existing Feature

[Complete modified requirement]

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Old Feature

Reason: [Why removing]
Migration: [How to handle]
```

If multiple capabilities are affected, create multiple delta files under
`changes/[change-id]/specs/<capability>/spec.md`—one per capability.

1. Create tasks.md:

```markdown
## 1. Implementation

- [ ] 1.1 Create database schema
- [ ] 1.2 Implement API endpoint
- [ ] 1.3 Add frontend component
- [ ] 1.4 Write tests
```

1. Create design.md when needed:

Create `design.md` if any of the following apply; otherwise omit it:

- Cross-cutting change (multiple services/modules) or a new architectural
  pattern
- New external dependency or significant data model changes
- Security, performance, or migration complexity
- Ambiguity that benefits from technical decisions before coding

Minimal `design.md` skeleton:

```markdown
## Implementation Details

[Specific implementation details such as:]
- Data structures and type definitions
- API signatures and interfaces
- File and directory structures
- Code snippets showing patterns
- Configuration schemas

## Context

[Background, constraints, stakeholders]

## Goals / Non-Goals

- Goals: [...]
- Non-Goals: [...]

## Decisions

- Decision: [What and why]
- Alternatives considered: [Options + rationale]

Decisions that meet the ADR criteria (hard to reverse, surprising
without context, a real trade-off — see "Architectural Decisions")
graduate to `## ADRs` as `### ADR-NNNN` entries; lighter decisions stay
as prose here under `## Decisions` / `## Goals / Non-Goals` /
`## Risks / Trade-offs`.

## ADRs

### ADR-0001: <short title>

Context, decision, consequences in 1-3 paragraphs. Only for decisions
that are hard to reverse, surprising without context, and a real
trade-off (see "Architectural Decisions").

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [Risk] → Mitigation

## Migration Plan

[Steps, rollback]

## Open Questions

- [...]
```

## CHAINED PROPOSALS

Proposals can declare dependencies on other proposals using YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: feat-dashboard
requires:
  - id: feat-auth
    reason: "needs user model and session management"
  - id: feat-db
    reason: "needs schema migrations for dashboard tables"
enables:
  - id: feat-analytics
    reason: "unlocks event tracking on dashboard"
---
```

**Fields:**
- `id`: Optional explicit ID for this proposal
- `requires`: List of proposals that must be archived before this can be accepted
- `enables`: Informational list of proposals this unlocks (not enforced)

**Behavior:**
- `cnb rocks validate`: Warns if required proposals aren't archived, errors on cycles
- `cnb rocks accept`: Hard fails if any `requires` entries aren't archived
- `cnb rocks graph`: Visualizes the proposal dependency DAG

**Commands:**
```bash
# View dependency graph (ASCII)
cnb rocks graph

# View graph for specific proposal
cnb rocks graph <change-id>

# Output in Graphviz DOT format
cnb rocks graph --dot

# Output in JSON format
cnb rocks graph --json
```

**Example Graph Output:**
```
feat-dashboard (⧖)
├── requires: feat-auth ✓
├── requires: feat-db ⧖
└── enables: feat-analytics
```

Legend: ✓ = archived, ⧖ = active/pending

## Spec File Format

### Critical: Scenario Formatting

CORRECT (use #### headers):

```markdown
#### Scenario: User login success

- WHEN valid credentials provided
- THEN return JWT token
```

WRONG (don't use bullets or bold):

```markdown
- Scenario: User login  ❌
Scenario: User login     ❌
### Scenario: User login      ❌
```

Every requirement MUST have at least one scenario.

### Requirement Wording

- Use SHALL/MUST for normative requirements (avoid should/may unless
  intentionally non-normative)

### Delta Operations

- `## ADDED Requirements` - New capabilities
- `## MODIFIED Requirements` - Changed behavior
- `## REMOVED Requirements` - Deprecated features
- `## RENAMED Requirements` - Name changes

Headers matched with `trim(header)` - whitespace ignored.

#### When to use ADDED vs MODIFIED

- ADDED: Introduces a new capability or sub-capability that can stand alone as
  a requirement. Prefer ADDED when the change is orthogonal (e.g., adding
  "Slash Command Configuration") rather than altering the semantics of an
  existing requirement.
- MODIFIED: Changes the behavior, scope, or acceptance criteria of an existing
  requirement. Always paste the full, updated requirement content (header + all
  scenarios). The archiver will replace the entire requirement with what you
  provide here; partial deltas will drop previous details.
- RENAMED: Use when only the name changes. If you also change behavior, use
  RENAMED (name) plus MODIFIED (content) referencing the new name.

Common pitfall: Using MODIFIED to add a new concern without including the
previous text. This causes loss of detail at archive time. If you aren't
explicitly changing the existing requirement, add a new requirement under ADDED
instead.

Authoring a MODIFIED requirement correctly:

1. Locate the existing requirement in `.rocks/specs/<capability>/spec.md`.
2. Copy the entire requirement block (from `### Requirement: ...` through its
   scenarios).
3. Paste it under `## MODIFIED Requirements` and edit to reflect the new
   behavior.
4. Ensure the header text matches exactly (whitespace-insensitive) and keep at
   least one `#### Scenario:`.

Example for RENAMED:

```markdown
## RENAMED Requirements

- FROM: `### Requirement: Login`
- TO: `### Requirement: User Authentication`
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

"Change must have at least one delta"

- Check `changes/[name]/specs/` exists with .md files
- Verify files have operation prefixes (## ADDED Requirements)

"Requirement must have at least one scenario"

- Check scenarios use `#### Scenario:` format (4 hashtags)
- Don't use bullet points or bold for scenario headers

Silent scenario parsing failures

- Exact format required: `#### Scenario: Name`
- Debug by reading the delta spec file directly:
  `.rocks/changes/<change-id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md`

### Validation Tips

```bash
# Validate a change (validation is always strict by default)
cnb rocks validate [change]
```

For validation debugging:

- Read delta specs directly:
  `.rocks/changes/<change-id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
- Check spec content by reading: `.rocks/specs/<capability>/spec.md`

## Happy Path Script

```bash
# 1) Explore current state
cnb rocks spec list --long
cnb rocks list
# Optional full-text search:
# rg -n "Requirement:|Scenario:" .rocks/specs
# rg -n "^#|Requirement:" .rocks/changes

# 2) Choose change id and scaffold
CHANGE=add-two-factor-auth
mkdir -p .rocks/changes/$CHANGE/{specs/auth}
printf "## Why\\n...\\n\\n## What Changes\\n- ...\\n\\n## Impact\\n- ...\\n" \
  > .rocks/changes/$CHANGE/proposal.md
printf "## 1. Implementation\\n- [ ] 1.1 ...\\n" \
  > .rocks/changes/$CHANGE/tasks.md

# 3) Add deltas (example)
cat > .rocks/changes/$CHANGE/specs/auth/spec.md << 'EOF'
## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Two-Factor Authentication
Users MUST provide a second factor during login.

#### Scenario: OTP required
- WHEN valid credentials are provided
- THEN an OTP challenge is required
EOF

# 4) Validate
cnb rocks validate $CHANGE
```

## Multi-Capability Example

```text
.rocks/changes/add-2fa-notify/
├── proposal.md
├── tasks.md
└── specs/
    ├── auth/
    │   └── spec.md   # ADDED: Two-Factor Authentication
    └── notifications/
        └── spec.md   # ADDED: OTP email notification
```

auth/spec.md

```markdown
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Two-Factor Authentication

...
```

notifications/spec.md

```markdown
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: OTP Email Notification

...
```

## Best Practices

### Simplicity First

- Default to <100 lines of new code
- Single-file implementations until proven insufficient
- Avoid frameworks without clear justification
- Choose boring, proven patterns

### Complexity Triggers

Only add complexity with:

- Performance data showing current solution too slow
- Concrete scale requirements (>1000 users, >100MB data)
- Multiple proven use cases requiring abstraction

### Clear References

- Use `file.ts:42` format for code locations
- Reference specs as `specs/auth/spec.md`
- Link related changes and PRs

### Capability Naming

- Use verb-noun: `user-auth`, `payment-capture`
- Single purpose per capability
- 10-minute understandability rule
- Split if description needs "AND"

### Change ID Naming

- Use kebab-case, short and descriptive: `add-two-factor-auth`
- Prefer verb-led prefixes: `add-`, `update-`, `remove-`, `refactor-`
- Ensure uniqueness; if taken, append `-2`, `-3`, etc.

## Tool Selection Guide

| Task | Tool | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Find files by pattern | Glob | Fast pattern matching |
| Search code content | Grep | Optimized regex search |
| Read specific files | Read | Direct file access |
| Explore unknown scope | Task | Multi-step investigation |

## Error Recovery

### Change Conflicts

1. Read `.rocks/changes/` directory to see active changes
2. Check for overlapping specs
3. Coordinate with change owners
4. Consider combining proposals

### Validation Failures

1. Run `cnb rocks validate` (validation is always strict)
2. Check JSON output for details
3. Verify spec file format
4. Ensure scenarios properly formatted

### Missing Context

1. Read project.md first
2. Check related specs
3. Review recent archives
4. Ask for clarification

Reading Details (for AI agents):

- Read `.rocks/specs/<capability>/spec.md` for spec details
- Read `.rocks/changes/<change-id>/proposal.md` for change details

Remember: Specs are truth. Changes are proposals. Keep them in sync.
